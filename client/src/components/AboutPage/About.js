            The centre for e-Learning (CeL), established at the ICT Centre, MNIT
            Jaipur, aims to impart quality education, in the easiest manner,
            with equitable access to learners across the nation. The main motto
            of CeL is to digitalize learning by conducting seminars, learning
            events, workshops in different fields. The portal will offer video
            lectures (recorded as well as live series), interview experiences of
            placed students, and many more, to enable students to learn at their
            own pace and pursue their interests.

            Everyone does not have the same view of the world, and their
            understanding of something may differ dramatically from yours.
            Sometimes you can even create something awesome in your career by
            asking their thoughts or inputs on something you might not even know
            or have heard of. CeL will give you chance to grow, to be open to
            new ideas, new ways of doing things, or new ways of thinking.
